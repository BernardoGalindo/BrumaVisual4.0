            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>My story is one of two worlds colliding: the rugged road of a 4000km motorcycle journey across South America and the precise, data-driven world of a biotechnological engineer. For over six years, I've managed complex environmental projects in the demanding landscapes of the Ecuadorian Amazon. This wasn't just a job; it was a proving ground. It taught me to see the world with two sets of eyes: the adventurer's, seeking the story and the feeling of a place, and the engineer's, demanding accuracy and technical rigor in every detail.</p>
            
            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>Bruma Visual was born from that intersection. My mission is to bring the world's most remote and beautiful places to life, not just through pretty pictures, but through immersive, data-rich experiences. I use advanced drone, photogrammetry, and 360° photography to capture the very essence of a location—the feeling of being there. For businesses and individuals, this means offering a way to showcase their projects, properties, or adventures with breathtaking detail and undeniable accuracy.</p>

            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>From creating detailed 3D models of complex terrain to building immersive virtual tours, my work is about providing a new perspective. The skills I've honed in environmental supervision—strategic thinking, problem-solving, and a relentless focus on quality—are the foundation of every project I undertake. I don't just deliver visuals; I deliver reliable, actionable insights wrapped in a compelling story.</p>
